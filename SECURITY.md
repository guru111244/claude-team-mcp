## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email the maintainers directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
